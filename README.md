### About the notebook.. ###

The ipython notebook is attached which gives some kind of info about the data to be used for training deep network for image tagging.

* First, its better if we can find the relevant columns for image tagging..
* Once those columns are found, the available domain values have to be checked for any errors and have to add some values if necessary.
* Then, once the domain values are fixed for every column, we can start filling missing values in the data.
